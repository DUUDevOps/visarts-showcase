# VisArts Showcase Portal
VisArts is a [DUU](https://duuke.org/) committee that hosts an annual Art Showcase, featuring 100+ pieces of artwork by Duke students. Every year, VisArts receives more art submissions than they can showcase, so VisArts committee members must vote for the top pieces that they would like to be showcased.

The VisArts Showcase Portal is a web application to handle artwork submissions by students, anonymous voting by VisArts committee members, and admin control by the VisArts Chair. The app was built in React.js and utilized Firebase for data storage (photos, voting data, and user info). The app was deployed and used by over 100 students in Spring 2020!
